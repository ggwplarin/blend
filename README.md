# blend
More color options for sassâ€¦

**Very much a work in progress.**
Based heavily on js functions by
[Chris Lilly](https://css.land/lch/)
and [Tab Atkins](https://www.xanthir.com/).

```
git clone git@github.com:mirisuzanne/blend.git
cd blend
yarn
```

The demo html & sass are in `demo/`.

- Change the values of `$channels` and `$range`
  to generate a new gradient
- Play with `blend.lch($lch, $a)`
  for direct access to colors
- run `yarn sass` to compile (gradients take ~6s)
